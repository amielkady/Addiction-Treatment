        <h1>Kratom Addiction Treatment</h1>
            <p>While kratom is an increasingly popular supplement that’s legal across the U.S., its use has been a subject of controversy, especially since long-term use of kratom can cause physical and psychological dependence.</p>
<p>Kratom produces a severe analgesic action, comparable to opioids. It also induces euphoria and sedation. As for the withdrawal effects, individuals struggling with kratom addiction will suffer from severe muscle pain and emotional turmoil.</p>
<p>In particular, people with a history of substance abuse might find quitting kratom incredibly hard.</p>
<p>Still, kratom addiction treatment is doable with the right help and resources. Most importantly, it’s essential to have a support system to alleviate the mental load.
</p>
            <h3>Understanding Kratom Addiction</h3>
            <p>
                Kratom is an herbal plant hailing from Southeast Asia. It produces an analgesic effect, similar to opioids, as well as a stimulant effect.</p>
<p>The use of kratom for pain relief is legal in the U.S. and the herb is readily available through many agencies. However, it’s crucial to understand that the use of this substance isn’t approved by the FDA, nor are there any indicated medicinal uses for kratom.</p>
<p>People typically take kratom to manage other drug withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings. Yet, studies show that regular use of kratom causes severe to moderate dependence.</p>
<p>Kratom can be ingested by:</p>
<ul></ul><li>Ingesting the raw plant as a powder or in a capsule</li>
                <li>Brewing kratom as a tea</li>
                <li>Drinking liquid kratom extract</li>
                <li>Mixing kratom supplements into food and drinks</li></ul>
            
          <h4>Effect of Kratom on the Body</h4>
<p>The main active constituent in kratom is mitragynine. This compound is an opioid-receptor agonist, particularly working on the Miu-receptors. It also affects serotonin and adrenergic receptors.</p>
<p>Accordingly, kratom produces a significant analgesic and sedative effect through its binding to the opioid and adrenergic receptors. Its affinity to the serotonergic receptors is also responsible for the euphoric activity of the drug.
</p>
            <h4>Symptoms of Kratom Addiction
</h4>
            <p>
Whether you’re using kratom recreationally or to mitigate the symptoms of opioid withdrawal, it’s crucial to monitor your physical and psychological well-being while on the drug.</p>
<p>Assessing if you or a loved one has developed kratom dependence is tricky. The reason is that kratom doesn’t have a recognizable smell, nor are there any noticeable physical differences in people addicted to kratom, unlike other addictive drugs.</p>
<p>If you or a loved one is worried about kratom dependence, here are some behavioral symptoms of kratom abuse you need to be aware of:
</p>
           <ul></ul> <li>Sudden change in behavioral patterns
</li>
            <li>   Erratic attitude, such as being overly talkative, violent behavior, and neglecting responsibilities</li>
            <li>Social reclusiveness as a method of abusing kratom</li>
<li>
Increasing the dose of kratom, despite uncomfortable physical symptoms</li>         
<li>Inability to stop using kratom</li></ul>
<p>
As for physical dependence, kratom causes the following symptoms:
</p>
            <ul>
<li>Breathing difficulties</li>    
<li>Constipation</li>
<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
<li>Profuse sweating</li>
<li>Shakiness</li>
<li>Weight loss</li>
<li>Flushed or darkened skin</li>
<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
<li>Hallucinations</li>
            </ul>
<h4>Causes and Risk Factors of Kratom Addiction</h4>
<p>Not everyone who uses kratom recreationally will develop an abuse problem. There’s a <a href="https://karger.com/nps/article-abstract/70/2/67/233720/How-Do-We-Learn-Addiction-Risk-Factors-and">significant correlation</a> between environmental stress and a family history of addiction and developing substance abuse issues.</p>
<p>The following are the risk factors that might make you or a loved one more prone to kratom abuse:</p>
            <ul>
<li>Family history of substance abuse</li>
    <li>Personal history of substance abuse</li>
    <li>Concurrent psychological conditions such as depression, anxiety, or personality disorders</li>
    <li>Childhood neglect</li>
    <li>Ease of access to kratom</li>
    <li>Peer pressure and lack of awareness</li>
    <li>Absence of social support systems</li>
            </ul>

<h3>Prevalence of Kratom Addiction in New Hampshire</h3>
            <p>
While kratom is a relatively new and understudied drug, its consumption and abuse are on the rise. Among the population of kratom users, about <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38441236/">25%</a> might develop a kratom use disorder.</p>
<p>People with kratom addiction usually consume kratom more frequently than other kratom users, have a history of substance abuse, and have a diagnosis of mental health conditions.</p>
<p>Kratom use is legal in New Hampshire for people over the age of 18, except for the city of <a href="https://www.wmur.com/article/franklin-becomes-first-municipality-in-state-to-ban-sale-of-kratom/28906594">Franklin</a>.</p>
<p>In New Hampshire, Kratom users report taking the drug to manage opioid withdrawal, alleviate pain, reduce drug cravings, and improve their mood.
            </p>
            <h3>Kratom Withdrawal Symptoms</h3>
            <p>
                Kratom withdrawal is incredibly difficult. Any long-term use of the drug can trigger these symptoms. However, the severity of the withdrawal symptoms depends on the longevity of kratom abuse, the mode of ingestion, and the dosage.</p>
<p>What’s more, people suffering from kratom addiction usually suffer from psychological conditions and lack the appropriate support, which heightens the emotional toll of kratom withdrawal.</p>
<p>In the first couple of days of withdrawal, people with kratom addiction might suffer from flu-like symptoms and drug cravings. The cravings intensify on days three to five, where the physical symptoms reach their peak.</p>
<p>After a week, the withdrawal side effects will begin to subside. By the second week, there’ll be a significant improvement in the overall well-being of patients. Still, many patients might have lingering depression and anxiety.
Common withdrawal symptoms of kratom include:</p>
            <ul>   
            <li>Intense cravings</li>
                <li>Irritability</li>
                <li>Anxiety</li>
                <li>Restlessness</li>
                <li>Muscle aches</li>
                <li>Tremors</li>
                <li>Sweating</li>
                <li>Insomnia</li>
                <li>Aggression</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How Kratom Addiction Treatment Works</h3>
            <p>Kratom addiction treatment usually involves inpatient admission, but some people might go through detox at home. It involves numerous steps, including the following:
</p>
            <h4>Detox
</h4>
            <p>The first step in kratom addiction treatment is eliminating the drug from the body. Since kratom withdrawal is deeply uncomfortable, this needs to be done in a controlled environment and under medical supervision.</p>
<p>In contrast, going through kratom detox at home increases the risk of a relapse, as well as physical and psychological complications.</p>
<p></p><a href="https://livefreerecoverynh.com/detox/">Detoxifying</a> the body from kratom can either be through stopping the herb cold turkey or by tapering off its use. Medical professionals will determine the most appropriate detox method depending on your or your loved one’s condition.
</p>
            <h4>Medication</h4>
            <p>Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) involves the use of certain medications to alleviate the withdrawal symptoms of addictive drugs.</p>
<p>Typically, these medications are approved for opioid use disorder. However, there have been reports of using pharmacological therapy, such as naltrexone or methadone, to manage the uncomfortable symptoms.</p>
            
            <h4>Rehabilitation</h4>
            <p>
In addition to removing the drug from the body and eliminating the physical dependence, managing the emotional turmoils of addiction is essential.</p>
<p>That’s because the therapeutic environment of rehab offers a safe space where individuals can explore their issues. They can also gain valuable tools to handle emotional triggers and develop healthy coping mechanisms.</p>

            <h3>Kratom Addiction Treatment Aftercare</h3>
            <p>You shouldn’t look at addiction as an isolated incident. Instead, it’s an ongoing battle, even after treatment.</p>
<p>People with a history of substance abuse are more likely to relapse or get introduced to other drugs and unhealthy coping mechanisms.</p>
<p>For this reason, consistent psychological care and maintaining a support system are cornerstones of kratom treatment. This involves the following: 
</p>
            <h4>Alumni Programs</h4>
            <p>Alumni programs help people struggling with various addiction issues maintain their sobriety. They offer ongoing assistance through peer support, education, and resources.</p>
<p>These programs give the person with kratom addiction access to numerous tools, aiding them with their ongoing battle.
The professional help found in these programs significantly eases people with addiction’s reintroduction into society and offers a chance for sober individuals to give back to the community.</p>            
            <h4>Support Groups</h4>
            <p>Since people struggling with addiction require social support and empathy, group therapy is invaluable. Support groups involve people with similar addiction issues who gather and share their experiences and difficulties.</p>
<p>These non-judgmental groups are a perfect opportunity for individuals to freely express themselves and find comfort.
</p>
            <h4>Therapy</h4>
            <p>Oftentimes, kratom addiction and relapse are exacerbated by underlying mental conditions. Accordingly, understanding one’s psyche and triggers will significantly ease the treatment journey.</p>
<p>In addition, even if a patient has no psychological issues, going through addiction and treatment can be incredibly isolating and traumatic. So, therapy will help relieve the shame of addiction.</p>
            <h4>Lifestyle Modification</h4>
            <p>Sobriety is an ongoing journey. It’s important to realize that people who are struggling with addiction need to notably change their lifestyle, including removing risks, reversing toxic patterns, and even avoiding certain activities that might trigger a relapse.</p>
<p>Instead, sober individuals can fill their time with other activities, such as meditation, art, working out, and partaking in alumni programs.
</p>
            <h4>Sober Homes</h4>
            <p>Lastly, sober homes are a safe way for individuals struggling with addiction to remain sober. These offer a safe and controlled living environment, free from triggers and risks.</p>
<p>Sober residences are particularly helpful for people with unreliable living situations or those who don’t have the proper support outside rehabilitation programs.
</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Kratom has similar, but less severe, physiological action as opioids. This has led many people to use the drug to mitigate opioid withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, using kratom for long periods is associated with dependence.</p>
<p>The drug induces an analgesic action, as well as a sensation of extreme happiness and euphoria. For this reason, people with secondary mental issues are at higher risk of developing kratom addiction, especially in the absence of the right support.</p>
<p>Fortunately, kratom addiction treatment is possible through detox, therapy, and rehabilitation. It’s a life-long journey, though.</p>
<p>People with kratom addiction need to maintain their sobriety by partaking in therapy, support groups, and lifestyle modifications. In some cases, they might benefit from sober living programs.</p>

        <h1>Marijuana Addiction Treatment in New Hampshire</h1>
    <p>Marijuana use is at an all-time high, especially among teenagers and adolescents. While marijuana doesn’t cause severe physical reliance, it’s incredibly addictive.</p>
    <p>Its long-term use also causes negative side effects, such as breathing difficulties and an increased risk of cardiovascular issues. Accordingly, if you recreationally use marijuana and find yourself unable to quit, it’s important to reach out and get the necessary help.</p>
    <p>Treatment for marijuana addiction relies on behavioral therapy. In particular, people with mental health issues and those without the proper support groups will benefit greatly from understanding their triggers and finding the right channels to fuel their energy.</p>

    <h3>Understanding Marijuana Addiction</h3>
    <p>Marijuana is legal for medical use in numerous U.S. states, including New Hampshire. It’s also legal for recreational use in 24 states. However, it’s still a highly addictive substance.</p>
    <p>Frequent use of high doses of marijuana leads to physical and psychological dependence. Though the physical dependence might be less than that of opioids and other addictive drugs, reliance on marijuana might still arise.</p>
    <p>In turn, this reliance might turn into addiction, as the drug alters the biochemistry of the brain.</p>

    <h3>How Marijuana Works</h3>
    <p>The main chemical in marijuana is THC. Its chemical structure is similar to the neurotransmitter, anandamide. Accordingly, THC functions as a neurotransmitter, binding to cannabinoid receptors.</p>
    <p>When these receptors are activated, they produce the analgesic and euphoric effects of marijuana.</p>
    <p>Over time, the expression of the endogenous neurotransmitter decreases, as the body accumulates to the constant presence of THC. Then, quitting marijuana becomes exceedingly difficult due to physical dependence, which can lead to addiction.</p>

    <h3>Risks for Marijuana Addiction</h3>
        While marijuana causes physical reliance through long-term use, there are some risk factors for the negative behavior associated with substance abuse and addiction. These include the following:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Frequency of Use</h4>
            <p>The more you use marijuana, the more your body gets used to the presence of THC. People with marijuana addiction typically consume larger amounts of marijuana more frequently, nearly daily. Additionally, adolescents are more likely to become dependent on lower doses of marijuana.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Psychological Conditions</h4>
            <p>Certain populations are at higher risk of developing marijuana addiction, even when using low doses of marijuana. These include people with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Previous substance abuse problems</li>
                <li>Family history of substance abuse</li>
                <li>Mental health disorders</li>
                <li>Personality disorders</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Social circumstances also play a major role in addiction. Peer pressure can significantly increase the risk of developing substance abuse disorders, especially in the absence of social support.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Rising Marijuana Potency</h4>
            <p>Marijuana products, even legalized ones, have been rising in potency over the last decade. Paired with the high availability of marijuana products and THC concentrates, you or your loved ones might believe you’re consuming a sensible amount of marijuana, only to become accidentally dependent on the product.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Symptoms of Marijuana Addiction</h3>
    <p>The symptoms of marijuana use disorder are rather discreet. That’s because using marijuana recreationally is usually socially acceptable, and obtaining marijuana is simple.</p>
    <p>Still, if you or your loved one are suffering from dependence on marijuana, you might notice the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Requiring higher doses of THC to get the same “high”</li>
        <li>Intense cravings for marijuana</li>
        <li>Spending a lot of time using marijuana, even when socially unacceptable</li>
        <li>Abandoning once enjoyable activities to use marijuana</li>
        <li>Using marijuana in risky situations, such as driving</li>
        <li>Trying and failing to quit marijuana</li>
        <li>Exhibiting behavioral problems due to marijuana use</li>
        <li>Experiencing withdrawal symptoms</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Prevalence of Marijuana Addiction in New Hampshire</h3>
    <p>Marijuana use is highly prevalent in New Hampshire. In particular, the rate of marijuana use among students and adolescents is significantly higher in New Hampshire than in other states, with about 26% of high school students using the drug.</p>
    <p>The reason is that there isn’t sufficient education on the risks of marijuana use. New Hampshire citizens have a low perception of risk associated with marijuana. When people don’t perceive an activity as harmful, they’re more likely to engage in it, despite its negative consequences.</p>

    <h3>Marijuana Withdrawal</h3>
    <p>Smoking or consuming marijuana a couple of times isn’t sufficient to cause withdrawal symptoms or warrant hospitalization. That said, anyone with a dependence on marijuana will experience withdrawal symptoms.</p>
    <p>The symptoms vary in severity based on the quantity and frequency of marijuana use. As for the psychological symptoms, they range from mild to severe, increasing in seriousness in select populations with a history of mental disorders.</p>
    <h4>Marijuana Withdrawal Symptoms</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Muscle pain</li>
        <li>Twitching</li>
        <li>Chills</li>
        <li>Stomach pain</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Vomiting</li>
        <li>Reduced appetite</li>
        <li>Intense cravings</li>
        <li>Rapid mood changes</li>
        <li>Anxiety</li>
        <li>Depression</li>
        <li>Lack of focus</li>
        <li>Memory changes</li>
    </ul>
        <h4>Marijuana Withdrawal Timeline</h4>
    <p>Symptoms of marijuana withdrawal might begin a couple of hours or up to 48 hours after the last THC dose. This ultimately depends on the frequency of marijuana use.</p>
    <p>Most of the physical and mental symptoms peak during the second to the sixth day. During this time, people going through marijuana withdrawal will require social support and counseling.</p>
    <p>After the first week, the symptoms will begin to subside. However, heavy marijuana users might go through withdrawal for up to three weeks.</p>
    <p>Typically, the physical side effects will diminish first, and the psychological symptoms may persist for months.</p>

    <h3>Steps of Marijuana Addiction Treatment</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Detox</h4>
            <p>The first step in marijuana addiction treatment is eliminating the substance from the body. Since the side effects of marijuana withdrawal are rarely serious, there isn’t any formal detox.</p>
            <p>However, it’s essential to monitor the psychological well-being of people suffering from marijuana addiction.</p>
            <p>Some practitioners might use medication-assisted withdrawal. This is particularly helpful for individuals with co-existing mental conditions or polysubstance abuse.</p>
            <p>The medications serve to alleviate some of the withdrawal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, pain, and anxiety. These are typically over-the-counter medications that pose no risk of dependence.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Psycho Counseling</h4>
            <p>Therapy and counseling are the cornerstone of marijuana addiction treatment. That’s because marijuana addiction is mainly psychological, and the physical reliance is minimal.</p>
            <p>Psychologically based addiction requires behavioral therapy. This helps people with addiction track their negative patterns, delve into the reasons for their addiction, and redirect their feelings into healthier alternatives.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, therapy will help people struggling with marijuana abuse combat cravings. It’ll also aid them in identifying triggers and finding the correct way to deal with their emotions.</p>
            <p>Counseling can be through traditional therapy sessions, support groups, or both. Support groups are a great helping hand, as they serve as social support that’s often lacking in the lives of people with marijuana addiction.</p>
            <p>What’s more, support groups have invaluable advice and are great sources of motivation for people starting their journey. There’s no better encouragement than knowing that someone has been where you are now.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Self-Help</h4>
            <p>Depending on the severity of marijuana addiction, not everyone who’s addicted to the substance will require in-patient withdrawal. Instead, many people with mild addiction have been able to wean off marijuana at home through some self-help methods. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Staying hydrated:</strong> Water helps the body’s natural detoxification, eliminating THC from the body faster. Avoid sugary and caffeinated drinks, which might lead to a crash.</li>
                <li><strong>Eating healthy:</strong> By fueling your body, you’re supplying your brain with the proper nutrients to rewire and start resynthesizing natural neurotransmitters.</li>
                <li><strong>Exercising:</strong> Exercising helps eliminate toxins from the body through sweat. It also boosts your mood, reducing the irritability associated with marijuana withdrawal.</li>
                <li><strong>Meditation:</strong> Meditation is a great way to put your mind off using marijuana. It gives you something else to focus on and helps you understand your feelings.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoiding triggers:</strong> The most important part of quitting marijuana is ensuring you don’t relapse. Since people suffering from addiction are at their most vulnerable during the first weeks, avoiding triggers and emotional situations is crucial.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Marijuana Addiction Treatment: What’s Next?</h3>
    <p>Addiction treatment is a lifelong journey. In fact, marijuana is one of the hardest substances to quit, despite having lower physical dependence rates.</p>
    <p>Since marijuana prevalence is at an all-time high, people struggling with marijuana abuse must draw up a plan to prevent relapses.</p>
    <p>It’s important to be realistic during your addiction treatment journey. It might take anywhere from months or years to completely overcome the desire to smoke marijuana. Contact us today and let our team at Live Free help you or your loved one through the recovery journey.</p>
